                     <p>Ayesha Kapoor is an Art Adviser based in Los Angeles, specializing in crafting personalized art collections that resonate with the unique tastes and aesthetics of her clients. Her curatorial vision is deeply influenced by her Indian heritage, along with her international travels to Venice for the Biennale, London for Masterpiece, etc., and her focus on various art forms during her Bachelor of Arts Degree at USC, specializing in Art History.<p>

                        <p> Ayesha has observed two significant challenges in the Global Art Market: the underrepresentation of various cultures in the art narrative and the inadequate promotion and support for emerging artists. <p> 

                            <p>For her clientele, Ayesha hence wishes to assist in acquiring artworks that align with their aesthetic preferences, facilitate their exploration of new and emerging talents within the primary market, secure timeless pieces from the secondary market, and employ art as a medium to bridge cultural disparities.<p>
