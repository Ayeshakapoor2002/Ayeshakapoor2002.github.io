                    <p>
Ayesha Kapoor, an art dealer with deep cultural ties to the rich heritage of India, is committed to curating art that aligns with her clients' personal tastes while offering them new and transformative insights. Her extensive experience in the art market, both in India and internationally has highlighted the underrepresentation of Southeast Asian stories in the global art narrative in her eyes.<p>

                        <p> Ayesha's endeavor is hence not just about curating art; it's about creating a dialogue across cultures and across people. By introducing the nuanced beauty of Indian art to a wider audience and bringing global contemporary art into the Indian sphere, this platform serves as a cultural bridge that eventually conquers the entire global art scene. 

                            <p>Join Ayesha on this journey of cultural exploration and mutual discovery, where each piece she presents is not just an addition to a collection but a gateway to new visual and emotional experiences.<p>
